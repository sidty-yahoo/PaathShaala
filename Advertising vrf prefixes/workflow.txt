R1 has a vrf TEST11
R2 has a vrf TEST22

R1 and R2 are ebgp beighbors for the address family ipv4 unicast
R1 and R2 are ebgp neighbors for the address family vpnv4 unicast
R2 has a static route pointing to null 0 interface for the prefix 100.0.0.0 as shown below

On R2
ip route vrf TEST22 100.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 null 0

Using the below commands on R2:

router bgp 2
 address-family ipv4 vrf TEST_22 
  redistribute static metric 10
 exit-address-family
Router#

Refer the interpretation of the command here:
https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/41325/redistribution-command?noredirect=1#comment64955_41325
(i am redistributing all the static routes present in TEST_22 routing table into bgp with a metric of 10)


Objective is to make R1 learn this static route:
---this can be done in the following way
--bring up the bgp vpnv4 neighborship between R1 and R2
--On R2, the export route target, should be same as the import route target of R1
